# 📚 Distributed Systems Lab – Smart Library System

Welcome to the **Distributed Systems Lab**! This project is structured as a hands-on, step-by-step journey through the complete lifecycle of building and scaling a distributed system using microservices.

---


## 🚀 Phase 1: Monolithic Smart Library System

Start with a simple monolithic architecture, where all core modules are tightly coupled in a single codebase.

**You’ll Learn:**

* Structuring a monolithic application
* Building core modules: `User`, `Book`, `Loan`
* Understanding monolith limitations in scalability and maintenance

---

## 🧩 Phase 2: Transition to Microservices

Break the monolith into loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

**You’ll Learn:**

* Decomposing services by business capability
* RESTful communication between services
* Managing independent data stores
* Concepts of loose coupling and bounded contexts

---

## 🌐 Phase 3: Reverse Proxy with Nginx

Introduce **Nginx** to manage and route incoming requests to the appropriate microservices.

**You’ll Learn:**

* How reverse proxies work
* Configuring Nginx for load balancing and routing
* Serving static files and enabling HTTPS
* Centralized access control and logging

---

## 🐳 Phase 4: Containerization with Docker

Containerize each microservice for consistent deployment and portability.

**You’ll Learn:**

* Writing efficient `Dockerfile`s
* Building, running, and networking Docker containers
* Isolating environments for each service

---

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Managing with Docker Compose

Simplify local development and orchestration using **Docker Compose**.

**You’ll Learn:**

* Defining multi-container environments in `docker-compose.yml`
* Inter-service communication using Docker networks
* Streamlining testing and development workflows

---

## 🚢 Phase 6: Optional – Orchestration with Docker Swarm

Explore real-world scalability with **Docker Swarm**, running services across multiple machines.

**You’ll Learn:**

* Setting up a Swarm cluster
* Deploying distributed services
* Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance

---

**Sample Topics:** Apache Kafka, Cassandra, Redis Cluster, etcd, Consul, MinIO, CockroachDB

---

## 🎓 Final Outcome

By completing this lab, you will:

✅ Design, build, and deploy a real-world microservices application

✅ Apply containerization and orchestration best practices

✅ Gain hands-on DevOps and system design experience

✅ Strengthen your understanding of distributed systems concepts and technologies
